# Introduction

A fundamental flaw in Self service checkout machines is that human-made items such as croissants cannot a exact weight, therefore the self-service machine cannot determine the exact quantity of human-made items you have placed in the bagging area.

This is not something the NCR corporation could program into the machines, every supermarket has different ranges of bakery products with varying weights. It would be the supermarkets responsibility to program in the ideal weights of products, but of course they won't.

All of this could have been avoided by hiring human workers instead of automating them. 

# Instructions

 1. Go to your nearest tax-dodging, human-replacing, "local" supermarket, at a quiet time.
 2. Find the croissants or bread in the bakery section, you may want to feed other humans.
 3. Place into the provided bag, don't put too many.
 4. Go to self service checkout, you can stop the annoying "UNEXPECTED ITEM IN BAGGGING AREA !" message by simplying touching the volume controls on the screen ![the mute button](https://github.com/Hussein-Ben/Croissants-hack/blob/master/mute_button.jpg)
 
 5. Start and Select bakery products  and only press 1 or 2 (you actually have like 6 in the bag)
 6. Place into the bagging area, there should be no warning and checkout will believe that you have only paid for 2 croissants when in fact you have taken 5.
 7. If anything goes wrong, don't worry just say that made a mistake
 8. keep your receipt and leave. 
 9. Share the croissants and be happy :blush:
